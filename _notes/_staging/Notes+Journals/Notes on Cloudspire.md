#### Who is indigenous to this place?
- Before the Empire?
Miners trading in precious gems, jewelry, craft, and metalworking. Comfortably isolated by distance, living within modest means. Built with timber and stone (some structures remain).

- Before the Calamity?
Mountainfolk. Lumber, ferns, gravity, raincatchers, goats. Cheese & fowl. Remote and scrappy. Little guarantees, least of all from The Mountain itself.  Gave things their original names, built with timber (few structures remain).

#### Daily life.
The majority of folk around Cloudspire, especially those in [[Bedrock]], will say they work in "mining". That encompasses not just miners themselves but laborers of many types; refiners, mechanics, transporters, suppliers, accountants, mesmers, and the many "invisible" supports that keep the many gears greased. Beyond mining and the privilege of independent wealth, the lower and middle classes of Cloudspire look similar to a place like Doskvol - tradesfolk, service (to industry or to nobility), and gambling on scrappy personal pursuits.

Relaxation and recreation take almost as many forms as there are Cloudspirians. [[The Roost]] and Raptor's Talon constantly compete to be *the* hub for nightlife. Typically [[the Roost]] holds "lower" fare and gambling while Raptor's Talon sells itself as "refined" engagements and establishments but neither truly lacks both. Swimming is permitted in any body outside of [[Mendar Lake]] and [[The Basin]] (the former for security, the latter for sanctity). In colder months, skating is common.

Cloudspire's stratified society creates an inherent tension between class lines. Plenty of actors try to navigate and manipulate to their own means, a few with good intentions, but the Emperor established very clear strata and most folks simply accept that as the way of life. By the time the Doskvol nobility "shakeup" news reached Cloudspire it had either been sanitized by Imperial mouthpieces (nothing to see here, move along) or decried by revolutionaries (a new face to "I got mine" - not *true* redistribution of power).

#### Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.
The major noble houses (Delgado, Sharif, Piantedosi, Lau, Rotterdam) that comprise the [[City Council]] reside on [[The Summit]] with its well patrolled streets and proximity to the council. The minor nobility primarily reside in Sparrow's Landing. The latter, while nestled within the city's outer ring, are still no stranger to privilege and security with regular Diamond Dog patrols, private guards, servants, etc. 

#### Architecture.
The earliest structures in Cloudspire are low timber-frame buildings - a few stories at most. Only a few of these remain either as quaint antiquities or barely-tolerated-by-the-empire functioning museums to local history. As the mountain's rich resources became apparent, stone and brick became commonplace and remain so today. The older the construction, the larger and rougher the stone walls and floors. It's only since the construction of the lightning barriers that metal frames began to reach into the sky; many with their upper floors brazenly windowed to allow as breathtaking a view as possible when the clouds part.

The style of these modern buildings is reminiscent to a visitor from a port city of ships and sailing vessels. Naturally, as metal for such constructions was unearthed, refined, and shaped, these same materials and processes was put to use in local construction. Large beams bend along slow curves, held together by exposed bolts and rivets. Even when clad in brick or glass,  facades still often resemble a ship's hull, capsized and sinking into the earth.

The most grand buildings are naturally dotted throughout the wealthiest districts; [[The Summit]] chief among them. The structures of bureaucracy straddle the line between historical homage and awe-inspiring futurism. Sparrow's Nest, home to the lesser nobility, is surprisingly restrained in comparison. Whether repressing extravagance for safety concerns or out of a love of history (performative or otherwise), the lesser noble houses are humbly beautiful. 

Pound for pound, the city's flashiest architecture can be found in Raptor's Talon. The public is kept at a distance from The Kettle, the Vulture's headquarters, but its striking profile can easily be appreciated from afar. A long beak-like building, the streetlights reflect strangely off its pale adobe walls - an unusual material for this region. Conversely, [[the Red Sashes]] practically invite the public to walk the courtyards that snake between the Klev Academy of Sword Mastery's offices and classrooms. The former dance school was a natural fit and the Iruvian's wisely chose to retain, even highlight, the classic charm of its stone and beam construction.

While, like the Kettle, you can only appreciate the exterior, [[the College]] of Lightning and its conjoined neighbor the [[Factotum Institute]] is the true gem of Cloudspire's architecture scene. It retains the timber framing of its original, quaint facade, but expansions and additions have since exploded from it, culminating in the dazzling observatory dome; carefully arranged shards of glass refracting light from within and around. It's no wonder the foremost thinkers of the city congregate here.

#### Dreams and Therapy
[[The Mesmer Institute]] stablished by the Empire (in the Immortal Emperor's infinite wisdom and foresight) when Cloudspire was brought into the fold and their mines deepened. Originally an offshoot of the [[Imperial Military]]'s psychonaut corps, Cloudspire's isolation and the end of the war slowly transformed the Institute into its own school of thought and methodology.

Mesmers, those who work at the Institute, are bound by an oath to keep any sessions and discoveries private. The institute reports, begrudgingly, to the [[City Council]] (though these reports are always intercepted and reviewed by [[the City Planners]]) and leans on their oath as much as possible to redact information.

#### What's in [[The Mines]]?
- Metal, gems, and ore.
- Horrors (ghosts, [[doppelgängers]], deepcreatures, the mythical Vürm, hallucinations).
- Dangers (cave-ins, floods, criminals, getting lost)
- Secrets.
- More prying eyes than folks think
Tunnels/routes are logged, monitored, and permitted by a combination of [[Local 251]] and [[The City Planners]]. Trespassing incurs a hefty fine (at minimum) while unauthorized digging is a severe felony. The deep mines are strictly off-limits; the last permits for it were issued during the war.

#### Trade, exports, etc.
Primarily metal and ore extracted and refined from [[the mines]]. The empire established Cloudspire as a fairly necessary supplier for Leviathan Hunting Ship and war machine materials. However, as soon as the war ended they found demand starkly declined and the 'tapped' war-torn mines abroad rejuvenated. They haven't settled into any new identity just yet, and may not need one: ore and gems have a fairly timeless value.

#### Ghosts and 'gangers.
When someone dies, their spirit is freed from their soul and, if left unchecked, after a few days will leave the body to roam and haunt its surroundings. [[The Vultures]] exist in Cloudspire primarily to quell the threat of these spirits. At first, most spirits are horrifying for all but a trained whisper to behold, but largely harbor to ill will to humanity. In due time, however, they will begin to hunger and even if sated, this hunger will eventually consume the spirit turning them feral. A feral ghost no longer retains any semblance of its former humanity and instead reviles humanity, seeking to destroy it. The spirits in Cloudspire seek to circumvent this process by becoming [[Doppelgängers]]. This double life seemingly overrides or distracts the hunger, allowing them to trade becoming feral for "life" as another.

The threat and fear of [[doppelgängers]] looms in the back of most Cloudspirian's minds (front of mind for Vultures, of course) and is a not-uncommon threat or political tool ("My opponent has changed his mind so many times one would think he's *not himself* anymore!" "We can easily *replace* you if you disagree, you know..." etc.). In reality, [[The Vultures]] do a very fine job tracking and disposing of bodies to keep the threat low and, at the end of the day, if a Doppelgänger does a good enough job... what's truly the difference?

#### Vultures.
Masters of the crematorium and hunters of spirits, [[The Vultures]] are gatekeepers to the real underworld of the city. Their territory is the sky - diving down from spires and rooftops, gliding silently in pursuit of the ringing bells that announce death from their warded bell-towers. Their membership is almost exclusively sourced from outside Cloudspire to help uphold anonymity. 

#### Prison.
[[The Island]] is the main prison of Cloudspire, a floating home for criminals of all variety. Brigs and holding cells exist throughout town for immediate needs but, once guilty, prisoners serve their sentence atop [[Mendar Lake]]. [[The Island]] moves, propelled by some secret mechanism (many rumors exist: big propellors, spirits chained to [[The Island]], a giant creature, etc.). Having been locked up is, naturally, a point of pride for many Cloudspire criminals. Through bribes, ingenuity, subterfuge, or a combo of all three, prisoners do manage get word in and out at great risk (if caught their sentences instantly increase). Dilly, serving a life sentence for lord-knows-what is considered the go-to on getting something in, out, or around [[the Island]]. How/why the guards "allow" this is something of a mystery.

#### *What's there to eat in Cloudspire?*
- mushrooms, birds, hagfish farms, potatoes. 
- underground grow-farms with garish electroplasmic light.
- imported luxuries and personal stores/farms for the wealthy.
- the rich.


#### Revolutionaries
[[Caz Mallock]]: [[Local 251]] political firebrand and Toskian; an adherent the seminal labor texts of Dieter Toska. Toska organized the Leviathan Hunter uprising of 555 IE where they and their comrades pushed for the Hunters to become an autonomous nationless fleet. While ultimately quelled, the uprising is nonetheless seen in revolutionary circles as a pivotal moment for the spread of radical labor expression throughout the Empire.

[[Passh Velkin]]: Red Sash ideologue motivated by a fiery desire for power. Iruvian political structures often encourage and reward ideologies like Passh's, but the modern foundations of this line of thinking can be tied to Vak Torvik. Vak rose to prominence in Iruvia by killing a motherfucker.
