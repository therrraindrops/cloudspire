[[RAPTOR’S TALON]] – The ever-lavish [[the Red Sashes]] are hitting the town once again. The theme: Cats & Dogs. Grab your finest attire (and a collar) and party in style at The [[Talon Hotel]] this weekend (assuming they let you in the door) and you might just make it into our next fashion recap.

GENERAL NEWS – We've caught wind of the rumor that [[Lock & Key]]'s infamous Festival of Handcuff Artistry is returning. For the first time in five years, locksmiths and tinkerers of all variety are being invited to take on the challenges constructed by the V., the enigmatic proprietor of [[Lock & Key]]. While no official invite has hit [[The Press]]' doorstop, a cypher was placed on our desk just this morning, recreated faithfully for you below. What could it mean!?

## Notes from Caz's latest speech
[[BEDROCK]] – here follows a truncated transcription of [[Caz Mallock]]'s dockside address earlier this week:

Mallock: Friends! We have lost labor's love. Wed as we are to the sweat of our brow we should need no other vow to see success. No marriage of convenience, least of all one of business, can separate us from our efforts and their returns.

(light cheers of "hear, hear", etc., from the crowd)

Mallock: But rest not on such laurels. Envy, spite, and greed seek not only to steal your returns from you, but to turn you from labor itself. Dismantle the bureaucracy within your mind. It is as Toska says, “my neighbor's labor is my struggle, too. We are divided to be exploited; let us instead be united in effort.”

I see you all in front of me - (crowd: "and we see you") - thank you - I see you all and I see Cloudspire. I see the earth that moves under our feet. I see the dim caverns they think will pave their bright futures. Let us take that future for ourselves.

(Mallock throws their fist into the air. The crowd cheers loudly and does the same.)

After a few parting words the crowd dissipated into the evening.

## Diplomacy/Disaster
[[THE SUMMIT]] – Delegates from The [[Ministry of Preservation]] and [[Dagger Isles Consulate]] met in Piyadasi Square this week. They declared a shared effort in supporting the Isle's merchants and sailors amid truly stormy seas. We previously reported on missing shipments and, per this declaration, it seems those sailors have been declared killed by the sea. We must all continue to do our part for the Empire.
