## Distinctly Dashing
*A collection of the charmingly elusive Dimitri Dashing's finer works.*

	The postmaster stood in the door, arm outstretched presenting a simple letter. In hindsight she would recall his nonchalance as terribly inappropriate for the gravity held by that letter in that hand. But how could he know? She envied the postmaster in this light; even before breaking the seal her heart knew the letter's contents.
	  
	The note fell to the floor, ink already stained with tears. "Please, no!" she cried, "Dimitri..." her voice faltered, caught in the back of her throat until the sudden rush of emotion forced it out:
	
	"Dimitri Dashing is dead!"

Three months prior.

I'm at the barbershop getting a little off the top. A man turns to me: graying, nosy, a wry smile forming across his mouth... the most commonplace clientele of every barbershop. "Hey, aren't you..." a million questions race through my head as his finger wags my way. Does he know me? Who is *me* today, anyways? How close is the nearest knife? What's my best way out of this shop?

"Yeah, yeah, you're that Schmidt kid, right? Ain't seen you in, oh, fifteen years but of course you were smaller back then (and I much handsomer...). Oh, the way my wife tells it I've never been handsome but let me tell you-" my nerves calm as his droning begins. I'm half this man's age at most but already worn old by my chosen profession. Perhaps it's time to grab my girl and retire to a balmy coast.

It's hard work to live a double life. Treading carefully through conversations, always asking yourself "who am I today?", applying mustache after mustache after... you get the point. But every day I wake up and begin a new life. Every day is my birthday - who else gets to say that? 

A balmy coast - hah! The very idea bores me. To sit idle, to only be **me** every day, what droll. And think of yourself, dear reader! To leave you, my accomplice in wordplay, to recount stories of old? It simply wouldn't do. I will risk life and limb to the very end if only to entertain your hearts and minds a while longer. If Dimitri Dashing leaves this life behind you'll find him six feet under the ground and nowhere else.

The job is going smooth so far - too smooth.

The guards are all sleeping soundly, thanks to one of my trademark tinctures. My target, a ruby apple gem, is in sight and ripe for plucking. Why then, does my hair stand on end? What have I missed?

Drop from my perch, slink toward the lord of this manor, make my terms known, take his agreement (or his life), abscond with the gem and escape from the roof. A simple plan. One I've done countless times. Why these nerves?

The lord's nonchalance. It's too practiced - knowing. I don't have time to consider how, who could have double-crossed me, but if Dimitri Dashing is known for only three things and roguishly good looks and a sharp blade are the first two; improvisation is the third. From my shadowy perch I throw my blade at the proudly displayed gem.

It shatters.

It would take a demon to so easily break a gem of that quality and, while devilishly good-looking, I am no demon. The shock on the lord's face as he turned to see the double-D's emblazoned on my dagger's hilt was as rich as this gem was about to make me. "I've foiled your ruse, Lord!" (I've omitted this lord's name here to save his meager pride) I announced, stepping down from my perch and into the light. 

He scanned the room for something - an escape, a weapon, anything to take him from the reality he was slowly sinking into - but found nothing but my dagger at his throat. "The ruby, if you'd be so kind," I murmured into his ear, "it'd be a shame if I had to search for it myself." With this line I pressed the dagger a tad harder to his neck. The lord, ever self-preservationist, wasted no further time opening his safe and delivering me my prize. I pocketed it, thanked the lord with a smooch on the cheek and, as planned, danced rooftops to the delivery rendezvous.

As my colleague finished delightedly explaining the grand designs they had for the apple, they got suddenly grave. "Dimitri," they implored "this city has a spirit of its own. I fear this spirit seeks to end yours. Tread carefully."

"My spirit is the city's spirit, friend. Worry not!" If I only knew where my story would lead.

I've often said you can't count money while your house is on fire but I never thought it'd happen so literally.

Glass shatters, voices yell, flames begin licking the curtains. Quite a greeting from the new neighbors. Threats and demands usually come before all-out firebombing so my curiosity was piqued. In short order a crazed individual with runes burnt into their skin jumped through the window dispelling all my questions. Cultists! Of course.

I pinned one to the wall with a dagger through the shoulder. The others I dispatched in short, gruesome order (I will spare my more sensitive readers the gory details) and tossed my washbasin on the growing flames, quelling their hunger. Once again in control of my domicile, I took to questioning my new wall trophy.

It became clear the cultist had not yet fully lost their mind once they lost the upper hand. We had a brief chat (helped along by my trademark tinctures, of course). Threats and grandstanding melted away to motives and superiors; precisely the facts I needed. I prepared my mental notebook and inquired into who orchestrated this operation but nothing could have prepared me for the name they gave...
