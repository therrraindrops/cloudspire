## [[Company of the Diving Bell]] sabotaging [[Bargers]]

	Target: Revolutionary/Refugee
	Work: Impersonate/Misdirect
	Connected to: Rival
	Complication: An element is a cover for heretical spirit practices.

[[Tia Balsam]] is reviewing/setting [[Mendar Lake]]'s lanes and partitions for the coming season. The Company has heard tale of tension around Balsam's current plans. [[Teclum Forrester]] has been the most vocal defender of Tia. Impersonate or misdirect his efforts to delay or, ideally, cancel/redirect the lane trawling entirely. [[Three Clovers]] is connected; she's been hired to track/protect Teclum.

(*Tia's work is secretly an arcane ritual [[The Drowned]] hope will negatively impact The Company - something horrific like turning the air in their rebreathers into acid, incensing spirits to their radio comms, something like that.*)

## [[Ink Rakes]] buttering up [[The Merchant’s Guild]]

	Target: smuggler/thief. 
	Work: sabotage/arson. 
	Faction: Merchant's Guild 
	Connected to: Ghost/Demon/God
	Complication: A Dangerous Gang Uses the Location

The Rakes want clout with [[The Merchant’s Guild]] and have heard of a thorn they can help remove. There's a derelict building that's been frustratingly off-market for some time; suspected to be a smuggler's den. Sabotage the operation or, if necessary, burn it down (just don't get caught or the Firelight bill will show up on your doorstep). Let the Rakes report it to the Guild when finished (and take the rep) and they'll pay handsomely.

*([[The Great Hunt]] found a demon pit. It's weak but growing thanks to the sacrifices they've made here. Death in the building won't ring any Vulture alarms, the demon pit will feed instead.)* 


## [[Factum Factotum]] needs something.

	Target: Doctor/Alchemist
	Work: Negotiate/Threaten 
	Faction: Imp. Military 
	Connected to: Crew Contact
	Complication: The job is a trap laid by your enemies. 

Factum knows of an old military doc who has so far been resistant to his "charms" and refuses to share the tinctures and antiseptics needed to complete important research. Show up and give the situation a little elbow grease, if you could be so kind.

*(The military doc is old, yes, but still active military. Factum has been convinced by [[Flint]] to set [[the Wing Shades]] up with this trap of a job in exchange for, well, tinctures and antiseptics.)* 


## Bustin' Makes Me Feel Goo'd

	Target: Occult Collector
	Work: Extract Essence
	Faction: Pigeon
	Connected to: Noble
	Complication: An element is a front for a criminal enterprise.

[[Antony Murano]], glassblower, collector, and lesser noble, has recently acquired a spirit essence that [[Pigeon]] would like to come into possession of (they have some questions for it). However you see fit, extract it from Antony's collection and bring it to the appointed drop location. Cheers, loves. 

*(Antony is allowed to keep collecting in spite of his frankly remarkable debt because he's a patsy. The Murano family operates a ring of drug dens throughout the city. If/when [[The Diamond Dogs]] come sniffing, Antony will take the fall and his comical debt will be leveraged as proof/wiped away in the proceedings.)*
