### The Marketiers (2S)
*A mix of venture capitalists and marketing consultants jockeying for position throughout their stepped building and the city at large.* 
**Turf**: The Ziggurat (HQ, [[Centre City]])
**NPCs**: Green & Sons (firm, refined, storied, draper-esque), Head in the Clouds (firm, “fun,” “family,” approachable), Des(i)gn (firm, trend chasers, cutting-edge, detached), Dusk&Dawn (firm, partnership, always mid) 
**Notable Assets**: printing machinery, a dependable network of town criers. 
**Quirks**: a firm’s location in the Ziggurat is directly correlated to its success and influence. The top floor is always empty because there’s always something more to strive for.
**Allies**: [[The City Planners]], [[The Diamond Dogs]], [[The Merchant’s Guild]]
**Enemies**: [[Arbuckle & Associates]], [[Ink Rakes]], [[The Red Sashes]]
**Situation**: when not working on the DD outreach programming, most Marketiers are working on a Red Sash hit piece. If successful, it’ll build an avenue into the city’s nightlife - either through or around the Red Sashes.
