### Local 251 (4S)
*Labor union for those who work in the mines.*

**Turf**: Meeting hall (HQ, [[Glitterpeak]]), [[The Mines]] and their entrances, union halls throughout Cloudspire.

**NPCs**: Franklin Jesop (foreman, tall, rugged, scrutinizing), [[Caz Mallock]] (spokesperson, fiery, revolutionary), [[Gina Batello]] (enforcer, hawkish, ever-present)

**Notable Assets**: fine mining equipment, massive wealth in raw materials

**Quirks**: The union does protect laborers, but more resources and representation are provided to the top members than expected/realized.

**Allies**: [[The City Planners]], [[Rail Jacks]], [[The Refinery]]

**Enemies**: [[City Council]], [[The Vault]]

**Situation**: Franklin knows about the Collegeâ€™s schemes, wants the Union to do something about it. Elsewhere the union is seeking to be an autonomous political body separate from the City Council.
