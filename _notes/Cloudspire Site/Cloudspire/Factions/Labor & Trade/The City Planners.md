## Tier: 5W
*A tight-knit group of architects and builders responsible for approving and supervising any new construction; the real power in Cloudspire.*

#### **Turf**
Seat of Power (HQ, [[The Summit]])

#### **NPCs**
(Architect), (Civil Engineer), (Construction Foreman)

#### **Notable Assets** 
money, material, power

#### **Quirks**: 
All construction needs City Planner approval before it can begin, unless the City Council approves it otherwise - a loophole the planners heavily incentivize against.

#### **Allies**
[[The Marketiers]], [[Local 251]], [[Ministry of Preservation]]

#### **Enemies**
[[City Council]], [[Cult of the Rising Sun]], [[Rail Jacks]], [[The Vault]], [[Tycherosi Consulate]]

#### **Situation**
The Planners are actively seeking ways to propel Cloudspire into the future, leaving its backwater reputation in the past. Theyâ€™ll acquire and subsequently control any venture they feel will bridge that gap.
