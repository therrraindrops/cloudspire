#### **Situation**
The changing boating byways erected by the Bargers are often described as arcane - they are. There’s a magical art required to maintain the health of [[Mendar Lake]] and its oft-overlooked position as a secondary lightning barrier. Spirits and other supernatural horrors bubble up from the lake routinely and are managed by the Bargers so long as they have adequate electroplasm - and they’re running low.
