### The Mesmer Institute (2W)
*The hypnotherapists that calm minds as much as they plunge their depths.*

**Turf**: The Institute (HQ, [[Bedrock]]), scattered shoestring clinics

**NPCs**: Karla Androzi (psychonaut, nerves of steel, impenetrable gaze), Leff (whisper, smug, uninhibited)

**Notable Assets**: home/emergency visit traveling therapists, high-end drug caches, session notes.

**Quirks**: their oaths don’t allow them to divulge any information gained in their treatments, but an oath can be broken for a very steep price. 

**Allies**: [[Spelunkers United]]

**Enemies**: [[Lock & Key]], [[The Waking Dream]]

**Situation**: session notes and discoveries are kept in locked, coded journals. A growing sect of Mesmers are comparing notes and building a map of clues to unearth what secrets Local 251 is working toward.
