### Ink Rakes (1S)
*Journalists seeking both a patron and credibility.*
**Turf**: The Press (HQ, [[The Roost]])
**NPCs**: June Abernathy (editor-in-chief, curious, dogged), [[Declan Scheer]] (pamphleteer, conspiracist, shrewd, gullible)
**Notable Assets**: ears to the ground
**Quirks**: Declan, having come from Doskvol, has some suspicions about Unseen membership. He’s keeping this secret very close to the chest.
**Allies**: –
**Enemies**: [[Arbuckle & Associates]], [[The Marketiers]], [[The Unseen]]
**Situation**: ‘Explosive journalism’ and ‘Cloudspire’ are strange bedfellows, but the Ink Rakes want to change that - need to, to survive the heat on them. They’re seeking a suitable patron to fund their efforts.
