### College of Lightning (3W)
*Cloudspire’s center of high learning. Highly selective; they only issue one scholarship per year.* 

**Turf**: [[The College]] (HQ, [[Raptor’s Talon]]) 

**NPCs**: Dean Clay (principled, stern, quick wit, well-tailored, hungry), Professor Albany (experimental, temperamental, transcendental), Celene (visiting professor, strict, ladder climber)

**Notable Assets**: tons of tomes, a window into the mines, a deep rolodex of wealthy patrons/alumni

**Quirks**: the college's domed observatory is mirrored underground; a little known fact of the College's construction. What’s known even less is what the academics can see below that bowl.

**Allies**: [[Cult of the Rising Sun]], [[The Red Sashes]], [[The Unseen]], [[The Vault]], [[The Vultures]]

**Enemies**: [[Factum Factotum]], [[Rogue’s Gallery]]

**Situation**: The Factotum Institute is growing, literally, into/onto the College. Dean Clay wants to turn this inconvenience into an advantage. If the Dean can find a reliable way to infiltrate, the secrets of the Institute can be folded into new curricula.
