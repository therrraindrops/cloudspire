**NPCs**: Minister of Organics, Minister of Minerals, Minister of Spirits, Minister of Secrets (ministers, titled, busy, surrounded by assistants, guarded)
**Notable Assets**: authority over transport and rationing into/throughout the city. 
**Quirks**: Fully infiltrated and run from the shadows by the Unseen. 
**Allies**: [[Blood Imports]], [[City Council]], [[The City Planners]], [[The Unseen]]
**Enemies**: [[The Drowned]], [[Iruvian Consulate]]
