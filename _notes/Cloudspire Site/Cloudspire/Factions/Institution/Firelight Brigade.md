### Firelight Brigade (2S)
*Put out fires, for a price (payment plans available).*
**Turf**: [[Emberglow Station]] (HQ, [[The Basin]])
**NPCs**: Albert Klaxon (owner, working past his prime, conniving), Stef (brigadier, swole, jovial, endlessly competitive) 
**Notable Assets**: portable water pumps and hoses, maps and blueprints to all but the most recent buildings.
**Quirks**: Only work if they’re getting paid; often help create problems for themselves to fix.
**Allies**: [[Bargers]], [[Lone Star Brigade]]
**Enemies**: [[The Dregs]]
**Situation**: The Brigade has put their weight behind the Lone Stars (brigades gotta stick together) for the town’s policing. To aid them, they’re planning a “controlled burn” of Coinpurse Alley to root out competition and provide golden PR opportunities.
