### The Island (4S)
*Cloudspire’s floating prison; never touches dry land.* 

**Turf**: The Island (HQ, [[Mendar Lake]])

**NPCs**: Warden Hammerschmidt (warden, iron fist, lifer), Dilly (life sentence, fickle, connected)

**Notable Assets**: arms to quickly suppress an uprising, boats for prisoner/mail transport

**Quirks**: Guards here work multi-month tours, only stepping off The Island when relieved of duty. The mechanisms by which The Island moves are a closely held secret that even the staff is largely unaware of.

**Allies**: [[City Council]], [[The City Planners]], [[The Diamond Dogs]], [[Lone Star Brigade]]

**Enemies**: [[Company of the Diving Bell]], [[Lock & Key]], [[Pigeon]], [[Rent-a-Haunt]], [[Rogue’s Gallery]]

**Situation**: The mechanisms that steer and stabilize The Island have been acting up. It’d be easy to contract The Company of the Diving Bell to investigate if they weren’t likely responsible.
