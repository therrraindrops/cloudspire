title: The Vultures
---

## Tier: 4S
*Plague mask wearing spirit hunters. Ever vigilant against the proliferation of doppelgängers.* 

#### **Turf**
The Kettle (HQ, [[Raptor’s Talon]])

#### **NPCs**
Beak (spokesperson, curt, rotating title, missing)

#### **Notable Assets**
eyes in the sky, bell towers, whispers for days.

#### **Quirks**
Membership is anonymous, favoring out-of-towners. Each vulture wears a tightly-sealed plague mask; the webbing of their glidesuits allows them to silently swoop down from the sky. 

#### **Allies**
[[College of Lightning]], [[The Diamond Dogs]]

#### **Enemies**
[[Blood Imports]], [[Doppelgängers]], [[The Unseen]], [[The Waking Dream]]

#### **Situation**:
The most recent Beak went missing after their public appearance last month. While easily replaced, a missing Vulture is cause for concern within the ranks.
