### Lock & Key (2S)
*Get locked up (sexily) or get things unlocked (illegally). All discreet and priced accordingly.*

**Turf**: Lock & Key Club (HQ, [[Raptor’s Talon]]) 

**NPCs**: Reuben (host, voluptuous, warm, accommodating), V. (leader, lock aficionado, icy, distant)

**Notable Assets**: Whips, chains, locks, lockpicks, deft hands.

**Quirks**: The business front is a high end kink club. The backend is dedicated to burglary and lockpicking. Both are equally beloved and important to the proprietors. 

**Allies**: [[Factum Factotum]], [[The Great Hunt]], [[Tycherosi Consulate]]

**Enemies**: [[The Diamond Dogs]], [[The Mesmer Institute]], [[The Vault]]

**Situation**: Hushed invites have started appearing for Lock & Keys’ infamous festival, returning after a 5 year absence. The finest burglars and locksmiths are invited (discreetly, of course) to test their mettle. The final challenge is releasing V. from the web of locks they’ve tied themself up in, as is tradition.
