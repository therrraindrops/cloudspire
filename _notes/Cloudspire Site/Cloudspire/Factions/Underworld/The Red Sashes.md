title: The Red Sashes
---

## Tier: 4W
*School of the Iruvian sword arts by day, hosts of lavish fêtes by night.*

#### **Turf**:
The school (HQ, [[Raptor’s Talon]]), high-end clubs throughout town. 

#### **NPCs**
Asket Kaff (arms master, politically-minded, sharp), Dyodiv Klev (headmaster, lineaged, reticent), Passh Velkin (valedictorian, fervid, idealogue)

#### **Notable Assets**
A bastion of master sword fighters. 

#### **Quirks**
The Red Sashes hold more political sway than the Consulate in many ways, but that means they’re less protected from Imperial might. One wrong step and their delicate egg shell dance will shatter beneath their feet. 

#### **Allies**
[[Iruvian Consulate]], [[College of Lightning]]

#### **Enemies**
[[The Diamond Dogs]], [[The Marketiers]], [[Pigeon]], [[The Wing Shades]]

#### **Situation**
The shine of a Red Carpet event is second only to the gleam of a Red Sash’s sword and everyone knows it. The Dogs have been sniffing around for a way to expose their corruption; they’d like to put an end to that as quietly as possible. “Or,” says Passh, “we call their bluff and go loud. This city could be ours if we wanted.”
