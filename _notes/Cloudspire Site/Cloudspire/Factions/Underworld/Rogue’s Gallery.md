## Tier: 2W
*Wheelers, dealers, but most of all art stealers.* 

#### **Turf**
Rogue’s Gallery (HQ, [[Bedrock]])

#### **NPCs**
Rogue (enigmatic owner, sporadic, apparently wealthy, discerning) Tenpenny (gallery 
manager, harried, shrewd)

#### **Notable Assets**
A growing gallery of masterful works.

#### **Quirks**
The Gallery makes both legitimate and illicit acquisitions (favoring the latter). A few pieces, rarely displayed, have mystical properties that entice beholders to certain actions. 

#### **Allies**
[[Company of the Diving Bell]], [[Spelunkers United]]

#### **Enemies**
[[Cabbies]], [[College of Lightning]], [[Lone Star Brigade]], [[Pigeon]]

#### **Situation**
Those who know know that Bedrock is the soul of the city and the way to move that soul is through inspiration. Get your grasp around who sees who and the images that stir their spirits and you’ll have the foundation of the city in the palm of your hand; just gotta beat Pigeon and the Lone Stars to the punch. Step one: secure a piece so sought after the masses will have no choice but to flock.
