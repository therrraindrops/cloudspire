### Pigeon (2W)
*Info broker to the stars (or so says their calling card).* 
**Turf**: Hidden lair (HQ, [[Bedrock]]), secretly-marked drop boxes in Bedrock
**NPCs**: Pigeon (info broker, anonymous, careful)
**Notable Assets**: informants and whisper networks
**Quirks**: Whoever Pigeon truly is, their presence in the burgeoning Bedrock underworld feels surprisingly ubiquitous for a one-person crew. 
**Allies**: [[Doppelgängers]], [[The Dregs]]
**Enemies**: [[Cabbies]], [[Lone Star Brigade]], [[Rogue’s Gallery]]
**Situation**: Those in the know know that Bedrock is the soul of the city and the way to move that soul is through information. Get your grasp around who knows who and what folks need to hear and you’ll have the foundation of the city in the palm of your hand; just gotta beat the Lone Stars and Rogues to the punch. Step one: take the others down a peg from the shadows.
