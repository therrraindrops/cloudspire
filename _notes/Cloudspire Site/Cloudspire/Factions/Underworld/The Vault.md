### The Vault (4W)
*The bank of Cloudspire. Not even remotely FDIC insured.*

**Turf**: The Vault (HQ, [[Coinpurse Alley]]), network of deposit boxes and local branches, extortion rackets with most mid-level businesses. 

**NPCs**: Martin Aston (President, driven, cutthroat, gaudy)

**Notable Assets**: trove of coin and gems, ample eager blackjacks, business records and deeds.

**Quirks**: Deposited assets are terrifyingly liquid; a run on the bank hasn’t happened (yet) but would be disastrous. The bank floor seems unguarded but tellers are well-equipped to act as their own security.

**Allies**: [[City Council]], [[College of Lightning]]

**Enemies**: [[The City Planners]], [[Lock & Key]], [[Local 251]], [[The Refinery]]

**Situation**: While they have a firm grip on the business of the city, the miners and their Refinery remain independently managed. This needs to change in the Vault’s favor as soon as possible.
