title: The Fortune Tellers
---

## Tier: 3W
*A coven of fortune tellers well-known, but never trusted, for their accurate predictions.*

#### **Turf**
Crystal Palace (HQ, [[Bedrock]])

#### **NPCs**
Carmine, Nacre, Phlox, Verdigris, Puce (fortune tellers, capricious, distant, cryptic)Â 

#### **Notable Assets**
coded prophecy tomes, high-profile patrons

#### **Quirks**
Only one teller gives fully true prophecies each day; the others deliver ones partially accurate or simply too vague to be untrue. Even they are never sure which of them it is until the day ends.

#### **Allies**
[[Factum Factotum]]

#### **Enemies**
[[The Great Hunt]]

#### **Situation**
Plenty of prophecies upset and disturb their recipients, but none like what the leaders of the Hunt were given. The Tellers are seeking muscle to keep the Hunt at bay.
