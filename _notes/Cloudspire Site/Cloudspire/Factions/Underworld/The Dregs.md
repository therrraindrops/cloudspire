### [[The Dregs]] (1S)
*Tea leaf reading assassins.* 
**Turf**: The Tea Room (HQ, [[Coinpurse Alley]])
**NPCs**: Three Clovers, Earl Grey, Bamboo & Juniper (assassins, polite, deadly, connoisseurs)
**Notable Assets**: many rare teas, a small stockpile of burglary and assassins tools
**Quirks**: All actions they take are dictated by tea readings and other such divinations. While not opposed to The Fortune Tellers, they follow a perpendicular prophetic path. Members are named after the dregs that gave them their first prophecy.
**Allies**: [[Pigeon]]
**Enemies**: [[Firelight Brigade]], [[The Unseen]]
**Situation**: Thanks to Pigeon’s information and the wisdom of the leaves, the Dregs have begun to unfurl a corner of the Unseen’s roster. A delicate and dangerous game to be playing.
