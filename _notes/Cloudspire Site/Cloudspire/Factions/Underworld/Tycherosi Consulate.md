### Tycherosi Consulate (3S)
*Embassy to a distant continent of non-imperials. Has an outsized presence here compared to the rest of Akoros.*
**Turf**: Embassy (HQ, [[The Summit]])
**NPCs**: Kax, Vyttyll, Phxe (diplomats, unorthodox, plotting, on guard) Operator Tellix (admin, fixed smile, cavalier)
**Notable Assets**: goods and texts heretofore unseen on this continent, fine textiles, blackmail lists.
**Quirks**: The rumor of the Tycherosi having demon blood is at least partly true; they each have a snuff pouch that helps them acclimate to the ‘purified’ air of the Imperial cities.
**Allies**: [[Blood Imports]], [[Lock & Key]]
**Enemies**: [[City Council]], [[The City Planners]], [[The Great Hunt]], [[Iruvian Consulate]]
**Situation**: The rituals being performed by The Great Hunt are affecting the Tycherosi diplomats. They need to locate the source of this interference and stop it without breaking face; their trade & import negotiations rely on nonchalance.
