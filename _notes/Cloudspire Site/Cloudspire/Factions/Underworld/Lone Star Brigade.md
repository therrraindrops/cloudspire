### Lone Star Brigade (2W)
*Wannabe sheriffs of this so-called lawless outpost.* 
**Turf**: The Station (HQ, [[Bedrock]]), The Bedrock Saloon
**NPCs**: Captain (leader, gregarious, straight shooter) Maurice (right hand, joker, midnight toker)
**Notable Assets**: squad of dedicated wranglers, cache of fine branded pistols 
**Quirks**: Each member has their own badge, belt buckle, and brand. Where possible they prefer to travel on mounts. 
**Allies**: [[Firelight Brigade]]
**Enemies**: [[Pigeon]], [[Rogue’s Gallery]]
**Situation**: Those in the know know that Bedrock is the soul of the city and the way to move that soul is through authority. Get your grasp around who needs protection and what folks need to feel safe and you’ll have the foundation of the city in the palm of your hand; just gotta beat Pigeon and the Rogues to the punch. Step one: Gain an invaluable endorsement.
