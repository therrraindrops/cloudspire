### Spelunkers United (2W)
*The bold souls that venture below the lightning barrier seeking bounty and knowledge.* 

**Turf**: The Depot (HQ, [[The Roost]])

**NPCs**: Alyce Dunspar (measured, obsessive, record keeper), Tin Tommy (persistent, seasoned, twitchy)

**Notable Assets**: Lightning hooks, gas masks, and other essential deathlands survival gear.

**Quirks**: few last more than 2 years with the spelunkers. Those that don’t get lost or killed in the deathlands usually lose their minds by that point.

**Allies**: [[City Council]], [[The Mesmer Institute]], [[Rogue’s Gallery]]

**Enemies**: [[The Refinery]]

**Situation**: Need bodies for an expedition; they’ve found something large.
