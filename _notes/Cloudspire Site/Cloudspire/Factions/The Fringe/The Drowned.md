title: The Drowned
---

## Tier: 4W
*Cult-turned-sanctioned-religion dedicated to the divinity of water. True believers are drowned and resurrected.* 

#### **Turf**
The Cathedral (HQ, [[The Basin]]), shrines and meeting houses across town, the basin itself. 

#### **NPCs**
Vicar 123 (), Sibling XYZ (), Brother ABC (), 

#### **Notable Assets**:
he Water Temple (HQ), The Reservoir, baths throughout town, a vault of tithes. 

#### **Quirks**
while openly tolerated and fairly well patronized, this religious institute isn’t exactly beloved. True believers are drowned and resurrected before becoming clergy, a practice that sets many at unease and stirs thoughts of doppelgängers. 

#### **Allies**
[[Bargers]]

#### **Enemies**
[[Company of the Diving Bell]], [[Ministry of Preservation]]

#### **Situation**
The Co. of the Diving Bell has located a sacred relic but is refusing to parley. A simple infiltration, framing another crew of course, should suffice.
