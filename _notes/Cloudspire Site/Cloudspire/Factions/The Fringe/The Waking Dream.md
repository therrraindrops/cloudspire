#### **Situation**
Called by the Dream, they seek odd, disparate items to fulfill the next step of their ritual to ‘awaken’ more of the city. The item list, like the ritual itself, is full of oblique allusions, inferences, and disjointed thoughts (ie. 5 books, three of which are related thematically, one homophone, and one that doesn’t yet exist - that kind of stuff).
