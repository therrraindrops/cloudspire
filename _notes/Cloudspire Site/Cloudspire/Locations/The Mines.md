Time 2 Dig

#### What's in the mines?
- Metal, gems, and ore.
- Horrors (ghosts, [[doppelgängers]], deepcreatures, the mythical Vürm, hallucinations).
- Dangers (cave-ins, floods, criminals, getting lost)
- Secrets.
- More prying eyes than folks think
Tunnels/routes are logged, monitored, and permitted by a combination of [[Local 251]] and [[The City Planners]]. Trespassing incurs a hefty fine (at minimum) while unauthorized digging is a severe felony. The deep mines are strictly off-limits; the last permits for it were issued during the war.
