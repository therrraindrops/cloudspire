Home to knowledge and learning within Cloudspire. 

It retains the timber framing of its original, quaint facade, but expansions and additions have since exploded from it culminating in the dazzling observatory dome; carefully arranged shards of glass refracting light from within and around.

The observatory looks up to the sky, tracking the movement of the sky and clouds. Its inverted sister peers into [[The Mines]] below the College's foundation. This under observatory is largely secret; the full understanding of what it can see is known only to the College's upper administration.
